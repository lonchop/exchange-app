<h1 align="center" id="title">Exchange App</h1>

Application developed as part of a basic Vue course for real-time cryptocurrency tracking. Although the course focused on Vue 2, this project is built with Vue 3 using Vite. Despite the upgrade to Vue 3, the project stays true to the syntax and structure of Vue 2, making use of Option API.

Integration with CoinCap API: Exchange App is powered by real-time data provided by the [CoinCap](https://docs.coincap.io/) API. This integration allows users to view current prices, market capitalization, and trading volume for a wide variety of cryptocurrencies.

Data Visualization with Charts: To provide a deeper and visual understanding of market movements, the project incorporates [vue-chartkick and Chart.js](https://github.com/ankane/vue-chartkick). These libraries make it easy to create attractive and dynamic charts that display the trends in cryptocurrency prices over time.
